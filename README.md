Separating further the document structure from the document content will have 
3 benefits 
1) would allow for separation of the design workflow and the application developer workflow such that the design of a web page could be changed independently of the need to make application changes 
2) reduces the amount of data in subsequent calls for pages using common document structure, thus providing a more optimal experience for mobile devices and incrementally reducing the stress on busy servers 
3) allows for the possibility that the end user can choose the document structure.

This repository contains a Proof of Concept implementation of the concept.

note to view examples you will need at least a lightweight web server, how about tiny web server ?
